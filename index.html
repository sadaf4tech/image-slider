                    <h2>Mountains</h2>
                    <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres above the surrounding land</p>

                    <h2>Ocean</h2>
                    <p>A portion of the ocean that is partly surrounded by land. ... Other seas surrounded by land include the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea. They contain saltwater and have been called seas for many years, but many oceanographers and geographers are more inclined to call them lakes.</p>

                    <h2>Jungle</h2>
                    <p>Jungles are overgrown with wild tangles of vegetation and dense forest. Jungles and rainforests are similar, but while rainforests have thick canopies of tall trees that block out light, jungles allow more light in, making it easier for plants to grow. ... Over half of the world's species live in a jungle environment.</p>

                    <h2>Island</h2>
                    <p>island, any area of land smaller than a continent and entirely surrounded by water. Islands may occur in oceans, seas, lakes, or rivers. A group of islands is called an archipelago. Islands may be classified as either continental or oceanic.</p>

                    <h2>Desert</h2>
                    <p>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid.</p>
